# sc_vortex_2d
Provide numerical result of s-wave Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon mode (CdGM mode) at $T/T_c=0.3, 0.5, 0.8$.
You can get eigenenergy, eigenfunction and pair potential.

## Description
It is known that there is low-energy excitation levels inside the vortex core in the superconductor.
The state is got by solving Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation self-consistently.

$$
\mathscr{H}=\int \mathrm{d}\bm{r}\sum_{\alpha}\hat{\psi}_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\bm{r})h_{1}\hat{\psi}_{\alpha}(\bm{r})-\frac{g}{2}\int \mathrm{d}\bm{r}\sum_{\alpha\beta}\hat{\psi}_{\alpha}^{\dagger}(\bm{r})\hat{\psi}_{\beta}^{\dagger}(\bm{r})\hat{\psi}_{\beta}(\bm{r})\hat{\psi}_{\alpha}(\bm{r}) \label{c3-1-1} %%%%%
